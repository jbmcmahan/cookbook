- 2 pounds small new potatoes (about 24), thoroughly washed and any damaged spots removed
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 cup water
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves or 2 teaspoons dried


1. Place the potatoes in one layer in a large saucepan and add the oil, butter, water and salt. Bring to a boil, cover and cook over high heat for about 8 minutes. Reduce the heat and continue cooking, covered, over low heat for about 10 minutes to brown the potatoes.
2. Add the rosemary and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes longer.
3. Serve.
