- 2 cups walnuts
- 2 cans (3 cups) chickpeas (rinsed & drained)
- generous pinch salt and pepper
- 2 tablespoon olive oil plus 1 T butter (divided)
- 3 cups yellow onion, diced ( 1  1/2 onions)
- 4 cloves garlic, rough chopped
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 cinnamon stick (optional)
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- orange zest- 3  large strips (½-inch x 2-inch slices -see photos!) use a veggie peeler.
- 2 cups vegetable stock or broth
- 1/4 cup pomegranate molasses or syrup (or make your own- see notes)
- 2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup
- 1 ½  teaspoon salt
- serve with saffron infused rice or Tah Dig ( Persian Rice)
- Garnish- chopped Italian parsley and pomegranate seeds


1. Heat a dutch oven over medium-low heat and toast the walnuts, stirring every couple minutes, until golden, roughly 10 minutes.  At the same time, chop the onions and garlic.
2. Drain and rinse chickpeas.
3. Set toasted walnuts on a plate to cool. Then place in a food processor and pulse until finely ground.
4. Heat oil and butter over medium heat. 
5. Add onions and cook until soft, golden and fragrant, about 5-6 minutes.
6. Add garlic, cook for 3-4 more minutes. When onion garlic mixture is deeply golden, add the cinnamon stick, turmeric, cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin and orange zest, and toast for 1-2 more minutes.
7. Add the broth, sraping up any browned bits.
8. Add pomegranate molasses, maple syrup,  and 1 ½ teaspoons salt, ground walnuts and bring to a boil, stirring.
9.  Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer 45 minutes, covered, stirring every 15 mins.
10.  Uncover, add chickpeas, and continue simmering until the stew has thickened and reduced,  10-15 more minutes, stirring.
11. Garnish with fresh pomegranate seeds and fresh parsley.
12. Serve with saffron-infused basmati rice, quinoa, or Persian Rice.


> Note: If you can’t find pomegranate molasses, make your own by pouring 1 cup pomegranate juice, 1 tablespoon maple, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and a pinch salt into a small pot. Bring to a boil, lower heat to medium-low, and simmer for 45 minutes until reduced to 1/4 of a cup. Set aside to cool.
